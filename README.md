Program in C++ language.

> IN CPP LANGUAGE
## Assignment 1: 
- PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Develop a program in C++ to create a database of student’s information system containing the 
following information: Name, Roll number, Class, Division, Date of Birth, Blood group, Contact 
address, Telephone number, Driving license no. and other. Construct the database with 
suitable member functions. Make use of constructor, default constructor, copy constructor, 
destructor, static member functions, friend class, this pointer, inline code and dynamic 
memory allocation operators-new and delete as well as exception handling
> Compiler Used:- Visual Studio Code or Dev Cpp

## Assignment 2: 
- PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Imagine a publishing company which does marketing for book and audio cassette versions. 
Create a class publication that stores the title (a string) and price (type float) of publications. 
From this class derive two classes: book which adds a page count (type int) and tape which 
adds a playing time in minutes (type float).
Write a program that instantiates the book and tape class, allows user to enter data and 
displays the data members. If an exception is caught, replace all the data member values with 
zero values.
> Compiler Used:- Visual Studio Code or Dev Cpp

## Assignment 3:
- PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Write C++ program to draw the following pattern. Use DDA line and Bresenham‘s circle 
drawing algorithm. Apply the concept of encapsulation.
> Compiler Used:- TURBO CPP


## Assignment 4:
- PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type. Implement the 
following
1. Constructor (including a default constructor which creates the complex number 0+0i).
2. Overload operator+ to add two complex numbers.
3. Overload operator* to multiply two complex numbers.
4. Overload operators << and >> to print and read Complex Numbers.
> Compiler Used:- Visual Studio Code or Dev Cpp

## Assignment 5:
- PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Write C++ program to draw a concave polygon and fill it with desired color using scan fill 
algorithm. Apply the concept of inheritance.
> Compiler Used:- TURBO CPP

## Assignment 6:
- PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Write a C++ program that creates an output file, writes information to it, closes the file, open 
it again as an input file and read the information from the file.
> Compiler Used:- Visual Studio Code or Dev Cpp

## Assignment 7:
- PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Write C++ program to implement translation, rotation and scaling transformations on 
equilateral triangle and rhombus. Apply the concept of operator overloading.
> Compiler Used:- TURBO CPP

## Assignment 8:
- PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Write C++ program to implement Cohen Southerland line clipping algorithm.
> Compiler Used:- TURBO CPP

## Assignment 9:
- PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Write C++ program to generate fractal patterns by using Koch curves.
> Compiler Used:- TURBO CPP

## Assignment 10:
- PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Write a function template for selection sort that inputs, sorts and outputs an integer array and 
a float array.
> Compiler Used:- Visual Studio Code or Dev Cpp

## Assignment 11:
- PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Write C++ program using STL for sorting and searching user defined records such as Item 
records (Item code, name, cost, quantity etc) using vector container.
> Compiler Used:- Visual Studio Code or Dev Cpp

## Assignment 12:
- PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Write a C++ program to control a ball using arrow keys. Apply the concept of 
polymorphism.
> Compiler Used:- TURBO CPP

## Assignment 13:
- PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Write a program in C++ to use map associative container. The keys will be the names of states 
and the values will be the populations of the states. When the program runs, the user is 
prompted to type the name of a state. The program then looks in the map, using the state 
name as an index and returns the population of the state.
> Compiler Used:- Visual Studio Code or Dev Cpp

## Mini Project:
- PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Design and implement game / animation clip / Graphics Editor using open source 
graphics library. Make use of maximum features of Object Oriented Programming.
> Compiler Used:- TURBO CPP
